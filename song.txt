One Love! One Heart!
Let's get together and feel all right
Hear the children cryin' (One Love!)
Hear the children cryin' (One Heart!)
Sayin': give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel all right
Sayin': let's get together and feel all right

Let them all pass all their dirty remarks (One Love!)
There is one question I'd really love to ask (One Heart!)
Is there a place for the hopeless sinners,
Who has hurt all mankind just to save his own beliefs?

One Love! What about the one heart? One Heart!
What aboutâ€¦ Let's get together and feel all right
As it was in the beginning (One Love!);
So shall it be in the end (One Heart!),
All right!
Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel all right;
Let's get together and feel all right
One more thing!
