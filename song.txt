One Love! One Heart!
Let's get together and feel all right
Hear the children cryin' (One Love!)
Hear the children cryin' (One Heart!)
Sayin': give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel all right
Sayin': let's get together and feel all right

Let them all pass all their dirty remarks (One Love!)
There is one question I'd really love to ask (One Heart!)
Is there a place for the hopeless sinners,
Who has hurt all mankind just to save his own beliefs?

One Love! What about the one heart? One Heart!
What about… Let's get together and feel all right
As it was in the beginning (One Love!);
So shall it be in the end (One Heart!),
All right!
Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel all right;
Let's get together and feel all right
One more thing!
